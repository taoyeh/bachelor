The line chart provides some interesting data regarding the proportion of students who know Beijing Opera in a certain Amercian university between 1950s to 2010s. The ratio of such  students rose gently from about 3% during the 1950s to nearly 9% during  the 1980s ,while the percentage jumped noticeably to around 80% during the  2010s.

There are two fundamental factors contributing to this social tendency.To with begin ,during the past four decades ,Internet  use everywhere, greatly affecting  every aspect in our daily life.As a result, an increasing number of Amercian students can learn Beijing Opera through the Internet. In addition,owing to the steady and rapid economic growth development of our countries ,people's living standard is imporving at a fast rate.Therefore,more and more Chinese students have studied abroad and brought Chinese culture to other countries,such as Beijing Opera .

With regard to this social tendency ,I firmly believe it is inspairing and positive.It is high time that government should promote our national culture .As this trend is still in its infancy,I am sure that it will no doubt go further and lead to future prospect.
